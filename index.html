    March 2023, an adventure full of excitement and hope began in my life. Along with my friends, we decided to visit Mr. Riyanto. That morning, we sat together and enjoyed a simple breakfast with the delightful aroma of freshly baked bread coming out of the oven. After satisfying our stomachs, we prepared ourselves for the challenging day trip ahead. Ranger (a pseudonym), my colleague, joined us carrying a heavy speaker that we would use on the journey. Despite the exhaustion, our spirits never waned. We stepped out with high spirits, ready to face whatever lay ahead of us. As night fell, we sat together in a room filled with new knowledge. The topic of writing materials flowed effortlessly from Mr. Riyanto. We absorbed every word he spoke with enthusiasm. Although our brains felt weary, our eagerness to learn never faded.
    <br>

    As we discussed and learned, the atmosphere became more relaxed. Rann (not his real name), one of our friends, arrived with a bottle of red wine. The bottle was opened, and the aroma of wine immediately filled the room. Laughter and jokes flowed like an endless stream among us. We tossed arguments back and forth and debated ideologies without ever seeking an end to our debates. The red wine accompanied us, providing warmth in the cold night. It was a meaningful day, where we savored every moment wholeheartedly, even though our brains felt hungry and tired.
    <br>
    The next day was one that would always be etched in my memory. With friends, we decided to visit the fiery Mount Merbabu. We stood near it, watching the black smoke rising from the mountain and merging with the blue sky. The grandeur of nature radiated, leaving us in awe.

    After admiring the stunning scenery, we continued our adventure by playing and joking together. Our laughter echoed among the rocky cliffs witnessing our moments. As dusk began to creep in, we paused for a moment and enjoyed a delicious bowl of warm soup. We shared stories and laughter, filling the night with joy.
    <br>
    After all, Life Is Absurd and It Remains So Forever
    <br>
    However, not every day brings joy. Some days pass without notable events, but each day still holds meaning and lessons. There are days filled with happiness, like when gathering with close family and meeting old friends who left a profound impression. But there are also sad days, when hopes are shattered and uncertainty looms.
<br>
Fate played a role, heavy rain pouring down as I was on my way home. Raindrops fell on my head, penetrating the raincoat I wore. Despite being soaking wet, I still felt happy and grateful for every moment I had experienced. Perhaps the rain was nature's way of reminding me that in life, there isn't always sunshine, but we can still find happiness amidst the gentle rain.
<br>
March 18, 2023, was a day full of surprises and unforgettable memories in my life. With friends, we decided to go for a walk after the rain stopped. The still overcast sky added a dramatic touch to the day. As we walked side by side, it felt like we were in a scene from a movie. I could feel every drop of water on my face and the sound of our footsteps echoing along the wet road. We all felt like actors in a story being written by destiny. Joy and laughter accompanied our steps as we enjoyed a delicious bowl of soup in the evening. We paused for a while at a 24-hour cafe to warm ourselves and chat until late at night, as if time had stopped in the middle of our journey. Finally, the day ended at 3 am with a sense of satisfaction and unforgettable memories. We continued our lives with various activities and events over the next few weeks.
<br>
March 24, 2023, I felt anxious and apprehensive when visiting his house to borrow a book that was still sealed. My mind was chaotic, and questions swirled in my head, making my heart uneasy. Each day passed with different feelings. The next day, I chose not to think about it, trying to distance myself from confusing thoughts and feelings. The day after that, I had the opportunity to attend a discussion event with the greatest writers in Jogja. The atmosphere there was so free and full of human spirit. Intense discussions and deep thinking inspired me. Literature became a beautiful medium for conveying human ideas and feelings. I missed the atmosphere of discussion in that forum, where ideas clashed and the creation of fleeting beauty occurred.
<br>
April 2023, I celebrated togetherness with my close family. Although there was no clear meaning, smiles and happiness filled the room. I felt very grateful for this moment, even though my life was filled with busyness and unanswered questions.
<br>
  
The next day, April 22, 2023, I met an old friend who left a profound impression. Our meeting was full of sweet memories and nostalgia. Rendi and Reza, friends from my gap year, brought stories and unforgettable experiences into my life. We chatted and laughed like we used to, as if time had never passed.
<br>
The next day, I spent time playing with my beloved younger siblings. Their cheerful laughter warmed my heart and filled me with happiness. But behind that cheerfulness, there was a burden in my mind. The Big Exam, H-30, was approaching, but I didn't feel ready and didn't have adequate progress. Anxiety began to creep into my mind, but I tried to remain optimistic and live each day with enthusiasm.
<br>
The next day, April 24, 2023, I experienced a moment filled with tension. I went to borrow a book that was still sealed at his house. When I arrived at his house, my heart was pounding, and my mind was filled with anxiety. Would I get the book I wanted? What if he refused or wasn't at home? This situation made my feelings fluctuate between hope and worry. The next day, the day passed without notable memories. However, behind that peace, my heart was still filled with doubt and anxiety. I tried to focus on academic tasks and keep my mind from drifting too much into the haunting uncertainty.
