“What do you have?” pertanyaan yang sering dilontarkan padaku. Entah bagaimana saya menjawabnya. “I have nothing.” <br>
I Did It <br>
A Latter to My Mom. 
When I got anything to be happy, I was forget about one thing which I had forget to say her birthday that, in last month, she has birth day. Eventhout, it must to prepare fucked up. I had to be glad to my Mom at anything to behave me when I born until now. I tremendously forgetting effort from my Mom. I love her so much. Mom, right now, I’m really gladful and grateful to be yours— 17–7–2023. <br>
I need to learn anymore and more serenity
<br>
Out of my mind, I’m to greed be about my idealism. I’m too grief  (I thought). I’m weird face (this fact). In other hand, I’m not megalomaniac, not left-wing, and not religious as well. I was accepting the fact that I have not deserve to my Lord. “no I am not, yours god complex blablabla.. there isn’t my answer that I had.” “fuck your god as your best friend or prophet.” I’m not what your think and your value. Yes, I have an exclusive and originality value of my personality about the universe it self. Universe could goes without the god.

    Life, just in case, kept flow with conflict. (Me, July, 07 2023)
<br>
Life, just in case, kept flow with conflict. From the smallest moments of personal disagreements to the global dynamic, conflict weaved its intricate threads into the fabric of our lives. Through the clash of opposing ideas and the collision of divergent perspectives, I had discovered resilience and the depths of my own convictions. Yes, it is about lean to the science that it will bring of better civilization.
    <br>
    When April 27, 2023, arrived, I felt a burning excitement within me. With my friends Rendi, Jian, Marry, Vita, and Reza, we decided to explore the city of Solo. Every moment we passed brought happiness and unforgettable memories. But behind that happiness, I still felt a void in my heart. Doubts and uncertainties about the future continued to haunt me.

Walking without incident. I tried to chase someone to watch the orchestra together, but it didn't yield results. Disappointment arose in my heart, but I chose not to give up and still hoped that there would be beautiful moments waiting in the future.
<br>
The next day, my mood changed drastically. (CENSORED). This news hit me hard. I felt shattered and empty. The feeling of hope disappeared, and emptiness swept over me. However, amidst the devastation, I tried to gather the remaining strength within me. I decided not to dwell in sadness and held onto the belief that life is more than just romance.
<br>
I hope to embrace happiness again. I refuse to be trapped in the sadness that has plagued my life. I begin to focus on a better future and set clearer life goals. In the process, I realize that life is too complex to rely solely on romantic relationships. I must seek consistent happiness and fulfill myself. In this struggle, I find strength in self-reliance and discover the true meaning of life.
<br>
In these past few weeks, my life has felt like an emotional roller coaster. There is joy, anxiety, happiness, and uncertainty. Each moment has a significant impact on my life journey, and I strive to continue moving forward with enthusiasm and steadfastness. Although there are dramatizations and challenges I face, I choose to see each of these moments as part of my unique journey and shaping me into a more directed individual.
<br>
During this period, my life unfolded with various events and emotions. There is joy, anxiety, happiness, and uncertainty accompanying it. Each day brings new lessons and makes me grow and develop as an individual.<br>
Thousand Gods, Life Is Too Heavy!
<br>
May 2023, I began to realize that something important. After discussing with friends, I realized that true happiness is not found in complex and worldly things. I began to seek meaning in the simplicity of life, finding consistent happiness beyond the hustle and bustle of the world. I realized that solitude could also bring true meaning to my life. Every moment of happiness I feel in Jogja, whether it's at a concert, gathering with friends, or enjoying art, I record with a grateful heart. I began to make peace with myself and think of a better future, without being too influenced by romance that sometimes makes us foolish.
<br>
June 2023, 15. The morning felt different. The air felt fresh, and hope filled my mind. I felt excited because today I would face a challenging Mathematics exam. Not only that, I also had a target to achieve a better grade than before. The desire to succeed and achieve high standards burned within me.
<br>
Upon arriving at the examination room, tension and anxiety began to envelop me. The atmosphere in the room felt quiet and tense, as if time was passing slowly. My hands trembled as I held the pencil and looked at the questions in front of me. Every question felt like a challenge I had to overcome.
<br>
I started working on the first question carefully, trying to make the most of every second. However, as the exam progressed, the questions became more and more complicated and difficult for me to face. Doubts began to creep into my mind. Could I solve this exam well? Had I prepared myself well enough?
<br>
As time became limited, I had to answer the questions with estimates and hope my answers were correct. Seconds turned into minutes, and the pressure began to weigh on my shoulders. Cold sweat began to trickle down my forehead. However, I chose not to give up. I fought against the anxiety and focused on the best effort I could give.
<br>
Finally, the bell rang, signaling the end of the exam time. I put down the pencil with mixed feelings. There was a sense of satisfaction for having tried hard, but also a fear of uncertain results. I left the examination room with a pounding heart, awaiting the results that would soon be announced.
<br>
Several days passed, and it was time for the exam results to be announced. In a room filled with tension, the names of the exam participants were announced one by one. My heart was pounding as my name approached in order. After what felt like ages, my name was announced as one of the participants who achieved a B grade.
<br>
A sense of relief and happiness filled my heart. All the hard work and effort I had put in finally paid off. I felt proud and confident in this achievement. The struggle to face this Mathematics exam became one of the most dramatic and emotional moments in my life.
<br>
In this moment, I realized that everything valuable in life does not come easily. Every challenge and obstacle is an opportunity to grow and develop. In every test, whether in the classroom or in life's journey, we must be brave to face it with spirit and steadfastness. Success is not only about achieving the desired results, but also about the courage to face fears and go through the process with full confidence.
<br>
July 2023, I got the chance to watch my favorite concert. Although the woman I invited couldn't join, I remained excited and enjoyed the concert. However, the sky suddenly opened up with heavy rain while I was on my way home. Despite being drenched, I still felt happy and grateful for every moment I had experienced. The next day, my hopes were high because of plans to meet someone special and visit a romantic art place. However, she hadn't arrived when the event started. Although initially sad and worried, I decided to still enjoy the event and understand that life is full of unexpected events. My heart remained worried. I searched for her in the crowd, hoping to see her bright face among the people. But there was no trace of her. At that moment, I felt disappointment and sadness overwhelming me. Every second, minute, hour, day, month, and year is part of life's journey. I learned to remain grateful for every moment given, whether it brings joy or sadness. In this life story, I realized that the true meaning of happiness lies in simplicity, gratitude, and appreciation for every moment we experience.
